- 最低基準は25-30％上がった銘柄
    - Many successful investors use 25% or 30% as their minimum earnings parameter.

    - To be even safer, insist that both of **the last two quarters** show significant earnings gains.
- 筆者は、40％から500％以上は狙うそうです
    - I prefer to concentrate on stocks that show powerful earnings gains of 40% to 500% or more.
